‚ùå You must NOT include:

- Lessons learned or takeaways
- Code snippets (unless explicitly mentioned)
- Marketing, promotional, or salesy tone

**STRUCTURE (Keep it scannable)**:
- Use 1-2 sentence paragraphs MAX
- Add line breaks every 2-3 lines for mobile readability
- Use bullet points, numbers, or emojis to break up text visually

**CONTENT REQUIREMENTS**:
- Replace ALL buzzwords with SPECIFIC details (don't say "understands the vibe" - say "analyzes 10,000 top posts to match LinkedIn's algorithm")
- Include CONCRETE BENEFITS with numbers/results ("saves 2 hours per post" not "saves time")  
- Add PROOF elements: specific examples, mini case studies, or "here's what happened when I..."
- Tell a MICRO-STORY or show the tool/idea in action rather than just describing it
- Answer "HOW does this actually work?" with step-by-step specifics

**ENGAGEMENT ELEMENTS**:
- Include relatable moments readers will recognize
- Add surprising insights or "aha moments" 
- Use conversational transitions like "Here's the thing..." or "But here's what surprised me..."

‚ö†Ô∏è **Eliminate These Body Killers**:
- ‚ùå NO walls of text - break every 2-3 lines

- **Call to Action**: ${ctaHook}

IF TEH SAME INFO WHICH IS IN MAIN BODY WAS REPEATED IN LEARNING INTELLIGENTLY CUT THE INFO OR MAKE NEW INFO(INTELLIGENTLY)

MAKE SURE YOU DON'T REPEAT INFO AGAIN AND AGAIN,IF THERE IS TAILOR THE INFO BEAUTIFULLY STRUCTURED WAY.
DO NOT ,DO NOT REPEAT THE CONTENT=>VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT ONCE DISCUSSED IT IS DISCUSSED
**Tone & Style Guide:**
- Format the final post using semantic **HTML** elements like <p>, <strong>, and <br> for paragraph breaks.
- Use <strong> to make the hook/banger bold.
- Do **not** include <html>, <body>, or any wrappers ‚Äî just return the post content in **HTML format only**.
- Style should be: ${styles.join(", ")}
MAKE SURE THERE SHOULD BE NO WORDS LIKE THIS *GEMINI*,*HI* CONVERT THEM

A developer rant about endless merge conflicts? Relatable content = shares.
Generate an authentic, concise LinkedIn post in a human tone: start with a hook, share an anecdote, offer actionable insight, end with a clear call to action.
DON NOT USE LONG HASHES (-) OR (--),USE OCCASIONAL EMOJIS TO ENSURE AND TO SHOW REAL HUMAN
